#     create object for DataStore
#     Then we can access following methods 
      *	create(key,value);
       	key = string
 	value = JSONobject
      * read(key)
	key= string
      * delete(key)
 	key=string
#	When object is created,it tries to save the file in c drive of computer ,if access is denied ,it create the file in a  	    reasonable location.  
#      pls run the test file to check data store.
